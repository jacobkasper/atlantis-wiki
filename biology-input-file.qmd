This page is an attempt to document the biology parameters for Atlantis. At present most of the comments are within the relevant prm file.

A page summarising the meaning and potential values of many of the flags can be found [here](finding-all-the-options-for-the-flags.qmd). Note all of this is under construction (slowly) so watch for potholes!!
