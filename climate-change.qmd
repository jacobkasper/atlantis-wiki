This area is for discussion of the modelling of ecosystems under climate change

## [Ecopath with Ecosim](ewe-climate-workshop.qmd)

 A workshop was held in Hobart - hosted by Chris Brown - that looked at climate change impacts on Australian ecosystems. Further discussion of this work can be found [here](ewe-climate-workshop.qmd).

## Atlantis

 Discussion of the handling of climate change in Atlantis can be found here (well soon, still under construction).
