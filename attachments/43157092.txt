Course material, including handouts and presentation and demos, are 
ordered sequentially based on the order taught in the Sept 2009 workshop 
in Seattle. 

These are essentially Beth and Bec's slides, repackaged, plus case study
material from the US and Mexico. And some slides stolen from Jason Link. 

The lab material for the 3rd day involved running 'broken' versions of Peters ECCAL/ CCAM
model, which was a very successful learning experience. 

See the AtlantisEcosystemModelCourseSept2009.doc for the schedule.
