### General Notes
- We will ignore the fisheries aspect of Atlantis for now. The database does not have scope to store these attributes at present.
- MINI should have two way communication
- Need to ensure that MINI and database remain as generic as possible. All Atlantis specific logic should be in the Business Logic Layer (see attached diagram [Drawing1.vsd](attachments/43155985.vsd))

### Where the functional group input data will be stored:

The functional groups specified will be stored in taxa  
The attributes associated with these functional groups will be stored in attributes.  
This is different to attribute relationships which defines data level attribute relationships (attribute and schema matching and cross attribute merging algorithms. e.g. if they can be summed)

Preliminary support for data entry Categories and parameter Groups has currently been implemented in specific data structures targetted at Atlantis. We need to make sure these are generic enough to support other models (inVitro, ...).

MInICat - MInI - [EBFM:model input interface] - attribute Category  
Categories are the equivalent of a parameter file.  
e.g. ams71_biol_dyn.prm - Biological parameter file for use with the southeast Australian version of the Boxmodel (Atlantis) model

MInIPig - MInI [EBFM:model input interface] - attribute Group  
Groups are the model parameters within each parameter file  
e.g. Identifier indicating whether vertebrate group is parameterised as a bird; isbirdFPS 0  
**I suspect that we have some redundancy here - we only really need to implement Categories, as the groups are automatically generated from the taxa - i.e. they are actually just an attribute.**

### To define the Atlantis functional groups:

#### Step 1

The user will be presented with a list of known functional groups. The will have the option of selecting one of these to use, basing a new functional  
group on an existing group or creating a new functional group from scratch.

When they have selected an existing functional group the species that make up the functional group will be shown. The user will have the option of  
adding or removing species from the functional group. If the functional group is changed it must be saved to the database as a new functional  
group before it can be used.

The user will also be able to create a new functional group - they will be able to select species to include in this functional group.

If a new functional groups is created either from sratch or based on an existing functional group a reference must be provided to allow it  
to be stored in the database and used.

At this stage the user will also have the option of importing data for the specified species.

#### Step 2

Par files are autogenerated using the functional groups specified. There will be a layer of business logic that will select the appropriate parameters to put in the  
par files.

#### Step 3

Mini uses autogenerated par files to config the interface.
