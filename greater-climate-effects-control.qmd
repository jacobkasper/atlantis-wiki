We have split flagtempdepend in two so you can turn on movement dependent on temperature without modifying recruitment and vice versa

To activate temperature dependent recruitment for any species set flagtempdepend_reprod to 1 and then set species parameters to indicate how the dependency is expressed.

To activate temperature dependent movement set flagtempdepend_move to 1. Similarly, for salinity to affect any species set flagsaltdepend to 1 and for oxygen dependent movement set flagO2depend to 1. Once these overall flags are set in *biology.prm* file, then to detail how those effects are expressed set the species level parameters as described in the manual which can be found on the [documentation page](atlantis-documentation.qmd).
