title: "R-code spatial analysis AtlantisNEUS"

I have created some R-code for spatial plotting analysis of biomass and catches (pr species) using the NCDF files as input (NEUS 1.0 model). The code is still under development, but seeing that there are several others who're developing R-code for similar purposes I'm also making mine available for to use/modify through GitHub:

<https://github.com/erikjsolsen/AtlantisNEUS_R>

Specifically the various pieces of code does:
- analyzingScenarioTable.r -- Script that creates heat-plots of biomass at end-time of different scenarios
- animation script.r -- Unfinished script that creates animated plots
- biomultiplot.r -- Function that creates faceted spatial plots of biomass of different components
- catchmultiplot.r -- Function that creates faceted spatial plots of catches of different components
- mappingNEUS.R -- Script that takes shape-file of NEUS region, creates R-objects that can be used by biomultiplot and catchmultiplot
- ModifyInputPRM.R -- Script used to change MPA settings in 'harvest.prm' file
- NETCDF manipulation v2.R -- "Working script" (draft) that does the same as biomultiplot - DON'T RUN!
- NEUS catch manipulation.r -- "Working script" (draft) that does the same as catchmultiplot - DON'T RUN
- PlotOutNC_NandRNandNums_NEUS -- Biomass/N plotting function developed by Isaac Kaplan, NOAA, NWFSC
- running biomultiplot.r -- script for running biomultiplot
- running catch_multiplot.r -- script for running catchmultiplot
- VertNamesInPlotOrderNEUS -- data file needed to run PlotOUt

Below is an example plot of the outputs using biomultiplot.r function
