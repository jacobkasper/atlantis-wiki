# Ice and Ice Algae

Conceptual models of Sea ice and ice algae in the Arctic and Antarctic

###### Extra Notes:
- Note for light limitation there is a threshold function - less than a minimum amount and it doesn’t happen
- Photoacclimation and photoinhibition occur
- Temperature dependent growth rates (humped relationship) with different species with different optima (so get seasonal succession)
- No ice = no growth (pelagic phytoplankton take over when no ice)
- Sinking important – rate is important for getting bloom timing right and for access by zooplankton
- May need to add P as well (so need N, Si, Fe and P) - Phil Boyd (get advice off him on whether need Fe or not, might be needed for pelagic phytoplankton)
