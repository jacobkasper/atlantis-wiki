## Mortality output files:

Atlantis generates two additional text files that contain functional group mortality information.

For the AMS model these files are called ams71_DynoutputRulesMort.txt and DynoutputRulesMortPerPred.txt

The mortality per preditor file contains the mortality of each group due to each preditor.

If the flagannual_Mest flag is set to true '1' in the run.prm file then these values are written to these output files annually. Otherwise these values are written out
