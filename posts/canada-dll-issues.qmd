Isaac is having more issues with dlls while trying to get Atlantis running on the computers in Canada.
  
I suspect this is because he has old code that was trying to use the debug dynamic link runtime library.
  
I have copied a run scenario to a clean windows vb and testing to make sure it runs. Its does. So the current code in the cvs respository is correct.

I'm going to compile the code using the debug version of the runtime libs and see if this causese issues. Yeah when i recompile the code using the debug dynamic dll runtime lib is get errors. I think that this is whats going on with the attempts in Canada.
  
When Isaac gets back to me i'll talk him through changing the runtime libs.
