It is possible to put in a time series of MPA coverage in a box to represent spatial management change through time. However, if you really just need to start/stop a static MPA once (i.e. start an MPA after a period of time or to stop an MPA after a period of time) then set

flagSimpleStartStopMPAs 1

and provide day to start and stop the MPAs using

All_

MPAstartyr   50   (or whatever year you want the run to start)

All_

MPAendyr 100
(or whatever year you want the run to end)

For those who read the earlier post, we need to add the All_ out the front of the parameter name to indicate that its for all MPAs (and to avoid a code read error, the code was getting confused with the read-in for the MPA vector per fishery).
