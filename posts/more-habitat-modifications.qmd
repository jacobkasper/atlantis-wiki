In the AtlantisDem branch we now have stronger space competition option (flag_competing_epiff). We have also added an option for a stronger tie of the benthic invertebrates to the habitat types too (flag_invert_biohab).

You will need to add the following to biol.prm and if you want to turn on these options set them to 1 (0 = off and old style habitat use by the benthos, which allowed for overlap rather than competition between species).

flag_competing_epiff 1 flag indicating whether corals, filter feeders and macrophytes compete for space
  
flag_invert_biohab 1 flag indicating whether inverebrates use dynamic biohabitat to condition growth
