We have removed one of the constraints on habitat dependency.

This means if you are using the bec_dev branch you need to fill out XX_habdepend flag for every non bacteria non detritus group (i.e. for primary producers, invertebrates and vertebrates).

If you are using AtlantisDem you need to add an additional column isHabDepend in the Groups.csv file

In all cases if the flag is set to 1 then the group is habitat dependent, to make it habitat independent set it to 0.
