The number of stocks per group is now listed in the Groups.csv file. To add it put in a column NumStocks after the column called
NumAgeClassSize. The contents of this column will be 1 for most models, but of you want to have spatially defined reproductive stocks (in stock_struct) put the number of stocks in here.
