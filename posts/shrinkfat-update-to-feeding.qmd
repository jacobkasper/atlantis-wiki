We are slowly adding the capacity to have respiration and metabolism more explicitly followed - so that DEB-like options exist in Atlantis. A part of this was adding a few new flags (covered in the
[flag options page](/display/Atlantis/Finding+all+the+options+for+the+flags)
). But if you're trying to get a model going and can't be bothered tracking down the options page.

flag_satiation 1    A Flag indicating whether there is satiation in feeding (1) or not (0) - mainly used by Holling type functional feeding responses
  
flag_shrinkfat 0   A flag indicating whether growth of fish allows fish to lose fat (1) or not (0) - only for fully age structured groups
