The max_available_habitat value has been added to the biology prm file. This will only be used and read in if the flag_competing_epiff flags is set to true.

The max_available_habitat default value should be 1.0 - this implies that the maximum available habitat is 100%. If you have habitat groups that can growth over each other then you might want to increase this.
