While checking the code was working for the Antarctic model I tweaked the code a little to make sure the correct scalars are used for vertical vs horizontal mixing within the transport model (it used to us horizmix even if delivering to the same box).

If you don't want to feel the outcome of this tweak you need to set vertmix to the same value as horizmix in the bgm file.
