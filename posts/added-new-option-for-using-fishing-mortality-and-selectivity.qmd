# Using mFC (fishing mortality) and selectivity

Previously when driving a fishery via fishing mortality (using flagF) you could only quarantine some ages where the mortality didn't apply by setting a minimum age of effect (using mFC_start_age). Now its possible to use a selectivity curve instead. To do this set

flag_sel_with_mFC      1        # This flag indicates whether using selectivity with fishing mortality (mFC) or simple age of first effect (using mFC_start_age)

The set selcurve to be the shape of the selectivity curve and use the relevant slectivity curve parameters as normal for fully dynamic fishing models.
