#### Changes to point source scaling

#### Changes to Assessment input file

The Assessment input file is now sampling an increased number of physical parameters. These are used as indicators in the CLAM-Atlantis project. The standard deviation of these parameters is needed so we are sampling the physical properties multiple times - the number of times these values is sampled is determined by the following new parameter (add before flagphys)

phys_samplingsize 1 # The number of times each physical sample should be sampled per sampling event. Unless you are have a need for a standard dev value then set this to 1.
