# Extra debug check added to run.prm (original code base only)

To facilitate doing some runs consistent with older code versions flagasta has been added to run.prm

If you set it to 0 then you have the more correct code version

If you set it to 1 then it reverses a bug fix - it makes the predators super aggressive in effect (more than intended from the parameterisation). I do not recommend using this setting and it will be discontinued in the new code base.
