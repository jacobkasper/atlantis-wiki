**Version: 6656**

We've had to change how we handle the recruitment and reproduction flags

flaglocalrecruit has now been removed from the prm file read-in. Instead we have moved this functionality to ExternalReproduction and RecruitType in the groups.csv file

Set ExternalReproduction to 0 if the group spawns within the model domain, 1 if outside.

For RecruitType

0 = independent distribution (use recruit_hdistrib)

1 = at parental locations

2 = external (into Migration Array)

3 = using a forced larval dispersal matrix

4 = salmonid lifestyle where recruit into the model before then migrating out again as a juvenile (returning later as an adult)
