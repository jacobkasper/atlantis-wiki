As requested i have changed the biology input code to read in values for KUP, KLP and KDEP for each functional group.
  
I have added these species parameters to the ecol_readSpeciesParam function so these are read in as per the rest of the species parameters. I have also got rid of the invertProps KDEP value - these are just treated as normal species parameters now.

This means that the input files need to change quite a lot. I have added these changes to the input file change page on this wiki.
  
This new code has passed a 50day ams test.
