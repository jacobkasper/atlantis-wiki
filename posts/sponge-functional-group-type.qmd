We have added a new functional group type - SPONGE. It acts largely like a coral (or other filter feeder) except that it is silica dependent and can be a bioeroder. To activate this functionality, in the functional_groups.csv file set the group type to SPONGE and in the isBioEroder column enter 1 instead of 0.
