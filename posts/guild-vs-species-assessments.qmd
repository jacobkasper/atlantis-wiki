**Version: 6678**

A new parameter setting has been added to the assessment options based on reference points (see the
[original blog](https://confluence.csiro.au/display/Atlantis/2017/01/12/Reference+Points)
on the topic as this new addition builds on that). A new flag has been added to
*harvest.prm*
-
**do_sumB_HCR**
. If do_sumB_HCR is set to 0 then the Broken Stick is applied per species as described in the original blog. If do_sumB_HCR is set to 1 then the rule will be applied at the guild level.
The guild is defined by
co_sp_XXX.
