The plan for today is to tidy up the calculations for prey availability.

So i basically want to create a new array that can be used in the getPreyAvail to get the prey availability of a group. This way we can get rid of the checks in pSPageeat and pSPEat and just use one array.
  
So the new array will be in the ecology structure and it will be called
  
spPreyAvail
  
This seems to work fine - doing a longer run to check the results.

If this is all fine i want to finish the conversion of the biology file to XML. This will allow me to really clean up the biology setup code.
