flag_report_water_detritus

Flag indicating whether to report detritus in the water column as well as in the sediment. Traditionally Atlantis has only reported detritus in the sediment.

Typically set to 0.

POSSIBLE SETTINGS:
0=do not include water column detritus in reporting. 1=do include detritus in the water column.

This effects the biomass summary values written to your log files as well as your BiomIndx.txt output files.
