In addition to the other effects of acidification a specific extra mortality term due to ocean acidification has been added. This uses a logistic curve which begins when pH drops below
pHmortstart_FXX. The shape of the curve is given by:

mPH =
pHmortA / (1.0 + exp(-
pHmortB * (
pHmortmid - currentPH)))

where

pHmortA is the maximum acidification induced mortality rate

pHmortB is the steepness of the curve

pHmortmid is the pH of the mid point of the curve

This new functionality requires
pHmortstart_FXX,
pHmortA_FXX,
pHmortB_FXX,
pHmortmid_FXX to be added for each functional group (FXX) in biol.prm
