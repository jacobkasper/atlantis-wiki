Still working on the conversion to XML.
  
There are a couple of big things i have to finish.
  
1. Input Paramater Groupings
  
I would like to add the input file groupings to the xml file. This shouldn't be too much work but i will need to change the xml paths used to read in the parameters to allow for the group names.

2. Units and recommended values
  
I really want to parse in the units and recommended values from the input file. This is not the easiest file parsing issue.
