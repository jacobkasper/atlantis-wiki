Before i check in the new changes i'm going to do a branch so that Beth can keep working on stable code and i will also have a stable version of code at all times to compare my output to.

I'll call my branch bec_dev.

This code has the FPTYPE key word for the floating type precision. The precision can now be changed by change FPTYPE from double to long double - atlantisMem.h for more information.
