A new parameter has been added to the force.prm file. This will set the frequency in which data is written to the inputs.ts and export.ts output files.

If you would like no change to this frequency you can use the following (assuming your model dt is 43200)

# Frequency of inputs.ts and exports.ts output - write out each dt.

  
inputs_tout 43200 seconds

If you would like to change the frequency Atlantis will recognise the following values:

# Frequency of inputs.ts and exports.ts output. Write out every 10 days.

  
inputs_tout 10 days
