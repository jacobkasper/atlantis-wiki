There is an issue with ncopen. If the netcdf file is not found its spitting the dummy.
  
I have added a seperate fopen before all ncopen calls that are just going to read the file to check that the file exists. If it does not a quit message is produced, else the file is closed and ncopen is called like normal.

This code has been checked into the cvs repository.

I suspect this is to do with the change in runtime libs and will need to chase it down. It will be added to the list of stuff to do later.
