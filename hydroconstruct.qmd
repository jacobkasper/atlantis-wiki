## Background

HydroConstruct creates the final format of the temperature, salinity and transport files required by Atlantis. It will read in files in a number of formats but its generally transport across each face as well as temperature, salinity and vertical flux per box.

The majority of the data read in has the level in the water column in the opposite order to how Atlantis reads them in, so HydroConstruct reverses this order.

It mainly changes the transport data into data per layer per box and handles hyperdiffusion.

## Code location

The hydroconstruct code in in the svn repository.

Repository details:

CSIRO Users: <https://svnserv.csiro.au/svn/atlantis/HydroConstruct>  
 External Partners: <https://svnserv.csiro.au/svn/ext/atlantis/HydroConstruct>

**Windows Users**

The code should be checked out using the same method as that used for checking out the full Atlantis source tree. Please remember to NOT check code out to a path that contains a space. So code should not go in My Documents.

Its best if you check out the hydroconstruct and Atlantis code in the following sort of structure.

If you do this it will make building the code heaps easier. If not following the following [instructions](updating-visual-studio-include-and-library-folders.qmd) to edit your Visual Studio projects to correctly map to your Atlantis code.

**Linux and Mac Users**

It doesn't matter where you check out the code. As long as you have installed the Atlantis libraries HydroConstruct will find them.
