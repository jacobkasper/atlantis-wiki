title: "Stepping through model issues by looking through the Atlantis code."

This is an attempt to help Atlantis modellers understand how to trace through the Atlantis code to track down model issues.

As Bec helps people with model questions she will aim to document the process on this page. These examples may not be exactly what you are after - if not please let her know and she can create a new page for your problem.

**Example 1. Icelandic model. Vertebrate not reproducing.**

Erla is having trouble with one of the groups in the Icelandic model. This group FMI is never reproducing. Why?

Code version - Atlantis trunk.

**Example 2: JRE model. Unstable tracer NH3**

Time: 0.000000e+00 The UNstable vari. 3 is NH3 in wc (offset: 0 NH3 in wc), its Pool = 0.06875, Netflux =0.0804023 on day: 0.000000e+00 in box: 6 layer 7

How do i find out what is happening to cause this high HN3 value.

Code version - Atlantis trunk.
