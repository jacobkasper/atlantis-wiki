If you turn this on (using configure --enable-link) then you must have the following libraries installed:

libnanohttp-dev  
libcsoap-dev (<http://csoap.sourceforge.net/>)

On most operating systems you will have to install these libraries from scratch.

Ubuntu - you can simply install the above packages using:

sudo apt-get install libnanohttp-dev  
sudo apt-get install libcsoap-dev

Other versions of linux and mac:

You will need to build from source. You can do this by building and installing a single package:

<http://csoap.sourceforge.net/downloads.php>

Follow the normal build and install process:

./configure  
make  
sudo make install

You may need to pass the configure script some variables depending on how you have set up your machine.
