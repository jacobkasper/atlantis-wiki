### Documentation

 This spreadsheet helps interpret predation pressure on prey groups. Major tool for figuring out how to redirect predation pressure during calibration.

### Files

Template [excel spreadsheet](attachments/43156984.xls) and the [documentation](attachments/43156980.doc) on how to use it. Note that as we have used Atlantis in more and more systems it has become obvious that diet connections for age structured groups > 0.6 can be common in some systems. So while you should always pay attention to that level of links they're not as rare as presumed 5 years ago when the documentation was first drafted.

### Discussion and Bug Fixes
