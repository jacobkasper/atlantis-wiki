###### Step 1:

In Windows Explorer right click on your existing code folder. In the 'TortoiseSVN' options select the 'Switch' option.

###### Step 2:

In the pop up window set the 'To Path' to be the path to your new branch 'Atlantis/branches/AtlantisV2_DVPT/atlantis/'

Make sure the revision option is set to 'HEAD' which means the most recent version in the repository.
