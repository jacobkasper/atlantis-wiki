Atlantis was originally built prior to the development of shp files so it uses a home grown bgm format detailed on the [Atlantis BGM Files](atlantis-bgm-files.qmd)page. There a few tools people have developed to aid in bgm creation and use
- [BGM2SHP](bgm2shp.qmd)
- [BGMEditor](bgmeditor.qmd) (our recommended tool).
- [BGM Mapper](bgm-mapper.qmd)

### Shapefiles

Shapefiles have been generated for most atlantis models.

These have been checked into the atlantis subversion repository at:

CSIRO users: <https://svnserv.csiro.au/svn/atlantis/GISData>  
 External Partners: <https://svnserv.csiro.au/svn/ext/atlantis/GISData>

These have been generated using the new BGM2SHP tool.

For information about projections etc please contact Bec and she will attempt to answer you with her very questionable GIS ability.

If you think the shapefiles are out of date please update them or contact Bec.
