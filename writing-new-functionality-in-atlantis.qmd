Option 1: Pseudo Code or Spreadsheet
- Write up the new functionality that you want as Pseudo code, pass us a spreadsheet or give us code in other languages etc
- We will then add this new functionality to Atlantis and do some simple testing.
- Generally good for you to test it properly as you know what it should be doing.

Option 2: You add the functionality to Atlantis
- We can create you a special branch in the code repository to use. Then you can play without impacting on others and we can help you merge it all back in later.
- Large learning curve due to complexity of Atlantis code.
- We need to write up some doco to assist this but its always hard to find the time.
