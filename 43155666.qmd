### Changing the executable name under Linux or Mac.

At present the executable for the bec_dev version of Atlantis is AtlantisNew. If you want to test multiple atlantis versions it can be useful to change the name of the executable created. This is a three step process:

1. Edit the Makefile.am in the atlantismain folder. Replace all instances of 'atlantisNew' with the new name - eg 'atlantisDem'.
2. Edit the Makefile in the atlantismain folder. Replace all instances of 'atlantisNew' with the new name - eg 'atlantisDem'.
3. Create a new copy of the 'atlantisNew.pc.in' file - change the name to atlantisDem. Don't worry about the 'atlantisNew.pc', this file is autogenerated.
4. Tell the autoconf tools to create the 'atlantisDem.pc' file. Edit the following section in the configure.ac file in the root code directory:

AC_CONFIG_FILES([Makefile  
 ConvertAtlantis/Makefile  
 atassess/Makefile  
 atecology/Makefile  
 ateconomic/Makefile  
 atlantisUtil/Makefile  
 atlantismain/Makefile   
 atlantismain/atlantisNew.pc  
 atlink/Makefile  
 atbrokerlink/Makefile  
 atCLAMLink/Makefile   
 atSS3Link/Makefile   
 atmanage/Makefile  
 atharvest/Makefile  
 atimplementation/Makefile  
 atphysics/Makefile  
 sjwlib/Makefile])

change the 'atlantisNew.pc' to 'atlantisDem,pc'.

5. Rebuild all the code:

make clean

make

Be careful that you don't check these changes back into the repository accidentally.
