### Usage:

HydroConstruct -f flowOut.cdf -t tempOut.cdf -s saltOut.cdf -r paramsSmall.prm

### Sample parameter file:

[params_17July2012.prm](attachments/43156182.prm)

Please check all parameters in this file and ensure they are accurate for your model.

This will generate three output files flowout.cdf, tempout.cdf saltout.cdf which should be converted to .nc files using ncgen.

Sample script to do the full process:

HydroConstruct -f flowout.cdf -t tempout.cdf -s saltout.cdf -r params_17July2012.prm   
mv saltout.cdf Done  
mv tempout.cdf Done  
mv flowout.cdf Done/flowout1.cdf  
mv volume1.cdf Done/volume1.cdf

cd Done  
ncgen -o SEAP132_temp.nc tempout.cdf  
ncgen -o SEAP132_salt.nc saltout.cdf  
ncgen -o SEAP132_hydro.nc flowout1.cdf

cd ..

If you have very large netCDF files its a good idea to split them into smaller (< 1G) files using tools like ncks.
