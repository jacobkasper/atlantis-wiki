The DietCheck.txt output file has been updated to provide more information about what each species is actually eating. The values are no longer just 0 or 1, they now give an indication of how much a group is eating.

This should be useful when tuning your diet matrix input parameters.

If the prey is an inverebrate

    value units are mgN/m^3 per second

If the prey is a vertebrate

    value units are nums per second

The values are calculated per timestep regardless of how often you print the values out.
