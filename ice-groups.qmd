The following new group types are present in the ice:

ICE_BACT:  
ICE_DIATOMS: //(diatoms)  
ICE_MIXOTROPHS: //(dinoflagellates)  
ICE_ZOOBIOTA: //(small zooplankton)

The best way to look at the relevant process code;

ICE_BACT ->Ice_Bacteria_Process()

ICE_DIATOMS->Phytoplankton_Process()

ICE_MIXOTROPHS -> Dinoflag_Process()

ICE_ZOOBIOTA -> Invert_Consumers_Process();

Most of these functions execute code based on the habitat so look out for the ICE_BASED section of the code.
