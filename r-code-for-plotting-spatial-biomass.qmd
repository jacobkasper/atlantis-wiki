This is R code for plotting maps of spatial biomass distribution (tons/sqkm). Creates a layout of 4 rows x 3 columns of biomass maps per functional group. This is useful for tech memos or any other place you want to include a map per functional group. Easily creates a publishable layout without the need of saving individual maps (i.e. Olive) or having to resort to a GIS.

Needs two data files:

1. Model shapefile
2. CSV of initial biomass per functional group per polygon (with a column matching the polygon ID in the shapefile)
